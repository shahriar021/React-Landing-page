# BangladeshIT Website Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Bangladeshit website. This README provides an overview of the website and its 8 main sections, as well as information on the libraries used in its development.

## Libraries Used

The Bangladeshit website leverages several libraries to enhance its functionality and appearance. Here are the key libraries used:

- **Material-UI**: We use Material-UI to create a beautiful and responsive user interface. Material-UI provides a rich set of components and theming options for a modern web experience.

- **React Bootstrap**: React Bootstrap is utilized for additional UI components and styling. It complements Material-UI to ensure a cohesive design across the website.

- **AOS (Animate On Scroll) for Animation**: AOS is employed for smooth and eye-catching animations triggered on scroll. It adds a dynamic and engaging element to our website.

- **React Reveal for Animation**: React Reveal is integrated to create stunning animations and reveal effects that captivate the audience. It adds an extra layer of interactivity and excitement to the user experience.

#### For responsiveness i have used media queries 

```
        @media screen and (max-width: 700px) {
    .about-us-main {
        margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;
    }

    .about-img {
        width: 100%;
    }
    }

    @media screen and (max-width: 300px) {
    .about-us-main {
        margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;
    }
    .about-img {
        width: 100%;
    }
    }

```
So for tablet 700px and mobile 300 or somewhere 360px.
